Currently supports Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble, Socl, Youtube, Vimeo, Google Plus, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Instagram and e-mail.

Allow your users to see your presence on 11 of the most popular networks instantly with no need for a knowledge of coding! Have links to your Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, Dribbble, Instagram, YouTube (and more!) profiles shown in a slick way, sure to impress your users.

Includes functionality to use your current Facebook image as the button that users press to draw out the network buttons, with automatic updating, pulled straight from Facebook!
